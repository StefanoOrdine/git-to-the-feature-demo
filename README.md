# Git to the Feature

This is the repository for the demo of [Git to the Feature](http://torinocodingsociety.it/events/torino-coding-society-8nov16/) event. The demo is about explaining and showing git town main features. You can find event slide [here](http://slides.com/stefanoordine/git-to-the-feature).

We are going to test some of the main features that git town offers, like `hack`, `new-pull-request` and `ship` analysing for each step the sub commands that are launched.

Enjoy!
